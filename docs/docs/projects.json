The clubhouse is integrated within one of the three‑story buildings, enabling a two‑story clubhouse with an accessible rooftop terrace as a central hub for relaxation, work, and recreation. In collaboration with interiors, the lounge, study, and fitness areas use a mix of materials and varied ceiling heights to create an inviting, home‑like atmosphere while keeping each space distinct. A defining feature is the rock‑climbing wall within a double‑height volume, with the second‑floor fitness overlooking the space for visual connection.",

To balance a modern aesthetic with traditional pitched‑roof construction, the design introduces a \"house pop‑out\" to enrich the massing and break repetitive rhythms, complemented by metal‑clad balconies that required new construction details. The clubhouse is divided into leasing, fitness, and lounge/study volumes linked by covered walkways, optimizing privacy and functionality for residents across amenities.",
